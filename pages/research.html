    <h1 class="entry-title">Research</h1>
    
    <p>My research is aimed at understanding active tectonic processes including earthquakes and volcanism through geodetic measurements and numerical modeling. I use a variety of geodetic satellite systems such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (<a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/insar.html">InSAR</a>) and Global Positioning Satellites <a href="https://www.unavco.org/instrumentation/geophysical/gps-gnss/gps-gnss.html">GNSS</a> to detect and monitor displacements and other surface properties. These measurements then constrain models of physical processes occurring at depth - for example fault slip or magmatic reservoir pressurization.</p>
<p>I currently work at the <a href="http://escience.washington.edu">eScience Institute</a> at the <a href="http://www.ess.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> where I am building an automated regional InSAR processing system with an emphasis on detection of transient surface deformation in the Pacific Northwest. <a href="https://github.com/scottyhq">This system</a> is being built using the latest Cloud-computing technologies and open source software. The goal is to provide valuable maps of changes to the Earth’s surface through time which will help inform assessments of regional natural hazards.

<h2>Pangeo Project</h2>
<p>Space-based geodesy is entering a new era in which measurements are <a href="https://eos.org/project-updates/earthquake-monitoring-gets-boost-new-satellite">routine and global</a>. However, scientists are having trouble keeping up with the flood of imagery from space. The <a href="http://pangeo.io">Pangeo project</a> is a community platform for Big Data geoscience that I am helping develop as part of a <a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/community/community-data-system-programs/access-projects">NASA ACCESS grant</a>. As NASA moves large archives of imagery to the Cloud, it is essential to have computational tools to operate next to the data, thereby circumventing the bottleneck of data transfer. Pangeo focuses on developing open tools for interactive and scalable scientific computing. If you are interested in learning more, see this recent <a href="https://medium.com/pangeo/cloud-native-geoprocessing-of-earth-observation-satellite-data-with-pangeo-997692d91ca2">blog post</a>.</p>
<h2>PLUTONS 2</h2>
<p>"Probing the Lithosphere Together..." or <a href="http://plutons.science.oregonstate.edu">PLUTONS</a> is a large international multidisciplinary collaboration with the goal of constraining how magma accumulates and erupts in areas of active intrusion and volcanism. The project involved a synthesis of many geophysical and petrological datasets collected at two locations in the Andes where magma is believed to be actively accumulating in the crust. See the <a href="http://scottyhq.github.io/../">Publications</a> page for many interesting results stemming from our studies, or watch <a href="https://mediasite.jsg.utexas.edu/UTMediasite/Play/c797152948614894b65f2f051015a6be1d">this seminar presentation</a> recorded at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics. Thankfully, we have received funding to continue studying these regions through 2020 ("PLUTONS 2") with funding from <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/grants">National Geographic</a> and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1757495&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF</a>.</p>
<h2>Snow + InSAR</h2>
<p>Measuring the water content in annual snowpack is a critical consideration for the nation’s water budget. In the western United States, 53% of freshwater runoff originates as snowmelt, and this water accounts for up to two-thirds of the input to the region’s major reservoirs. I'm currently investigating ways to improve hydrological models and water management with satellite-based synthetic aperture radar snowpack measurements. Satellite InSAR is an appealing technique to measure snowpack properties because measurements are unaffected by clouds and can provide global coverage with weekly repeats.
