I'm a research scientist in the Earth and Space Sciences Department at the University of Washington. My research focuses on the application of satellite observations to understand and monitor terrestrial natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions, landslides, and earthquakes. If Iâ€™m not considering the view from satellites then I am exploring on ground, whether in my own backyard or abroad. I try to keep this webpage up-to-date with current professional activities. If you're looking for something in particular don't hesitate to get in touch!
