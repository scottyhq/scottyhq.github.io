I'm a research scientist in the [Earth and Space Sciences Department](https://ess.uw.edu) at the University of Washington and Data Science Fellow at the [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu). My research focuses on the application of satellite observations to understand and monitor terrestrial natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions, landslides, and earthquakes. If Iâ€™m not considering the view from satellites then I am exploring on ground, whether in my own backyard or abroad. I try to keep this webpage up-to-date with current professional activities. If you're looking for something in particular don't hesitate to get in touch!
