Title: Software
Date: 2025-09-29

Open source software development is central for reproducible open science. As part of my time as a Data Science Fellow at the UW eScience Institute I contribute to many open-source software projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/scottyhq). Here are a few recent ones:

## Xarray
[Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) is an open source project and Python package that introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates, and attributes on top of raw NumPy-like arrays, which allows for more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone user experience. This is a fundamental piece of software for working with multi-dimensional gridded geoscience data!

I'm a member of the Xarray Core team, helping to bring in grants to fund software developers, run workshops and develop the [Xarray Tutorial Website](https://tutorial.xarray.dev/intro.html).

## Coincident

A [Python library](https://coincident.readthedocs.io) for efficient, on-demand search, subsetting, and data access of datasets relevant to NASA's [Surface Topography and Vegetation (STV) program](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/decadal-surveys/decadal-stv/)

## SlideRule

[Sliderule](https://slideruleearth.io/web/) is a Cloud-processing framework for interactive analysis of NASA's ICESat-2 dataset. It makes working with a very large and complicated geospatial vector dataset intuitive and interactive.


## Pangeo Docker Images

Reproducible scientific computations require sophisticated dependency management. This project maintains default environment for geospatial workflows with Python, including machine-learning libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch: [https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images)
