## UW eScience Hackweeks

I help organize the annual ["Hackweeks"](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/) for the University of Washington eScience Institute. These are short duration participant-driven events with the goal of learning the latest open source software tools available to geoscientists. Also checkout out our guidebook (https://guidebook.hackweek.io/intro.html).

## Pangeo Tutorials

Co-taught an AGU 2019 workshop for the Pangeo community: "Hands on with JupyterHub and Open-source Python Tools for Scalable Analysis of Big Data in the Geosciences". Materials [here](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-tutorial) and regularly updated interactive versions are on the [Pangeo Gallery](https://gallery.pangeo.io).

## Geodynamics

Taught in 2016 at [Universidad de los Andes](https://geociencias.uniandes.edu.co), Bogota, Colombia. Most homework assignments were done as Jupyter Notebooks, made available [here](https://github.com/scottyhq/gpsdemo).

## InSAR short courses

I've helped teach sections at the annual UNAVCO / Earthscope InSAR trainings (https://github.com/parosen/Geo-SInC).

Co-taught a multi-day InSAR workshop at the IAVCEI Cities on Volcanoes 9 conference. A programming exercise from the course is available [here](https://github.com/scottyhq/cov9)
