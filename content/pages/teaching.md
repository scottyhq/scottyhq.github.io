# Geohackweek

I help organize the annual ["Geohackweek"](https://geohackweek.github.io) at the University of Washington. It is a fantastic one week participant-driven event with the goal of learning the latest open source software tools available to geoscientists.

# Geodynamics

Taught in 2016 at [Universidad de los Andes](http://geociencias.uniandes.edu.co), Bogota, Colombia. Most homework assignments were done as Jupyter Notebooks, made available [here](add link).

# InSAR short course

Co-taught a multi-day InSAR workshop at the IAVCEI Cities on Volcanoes 9 conference. A programming exercise from the course is available [here](https://github.com/scottyhq/cov9)
