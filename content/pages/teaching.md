## Tutorials and Workshops

Most of my teaching takes place at short-format workshops!

### UW eScience Hackweeks

I help organize the annual ["Hackweeks"](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/) for the University of Washington eScience Institute. These are short duration participant-driven events with the goal of learning the latest open source software tools available to geoscientists. Also checkout out our guidebook (https://guidebook.hackweek.io/intro.html).

### Xarray Tutorial

I help maintain the Xarray software library's [online tutorial content](https://tutorial.xarray.dev), and have helped organize in-person trainings using this content at the annual SciPy conference. You can read more about this effort on the [Xarray Blog](https://xarray.dev/blog/xarray-tutorial).

### Pangeo Tutorials

Co-taught an AGU 2019 workshop for the Pangeo community: "Hands on with JupyterHub and Open-source Python Tools for Scalable Analysis of Big Data in the Geosciences". Materials [here](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-tutorial) and regularly updated interactive versions are on the [Pangeo Gallery](https://gallery.pangeo.io).

### InSAR short courses

I've helped teach sections at the annual UNAVCO / Earthscope InSAR trainings (https://github.com/parosen/Geo-SInC).

Co-taught a multi-day InSAR workshop at the IAVCEI Cities on Volcanoes 9 conference. A programming exercise from the course is available [here](https://github.com/scottyhq/cov9)


## University Courses

### GeoSmart

GeoScience MAchine Learning Resources and Training [(GeoSMART)](https://geo-smart.github.io) was an NSF-funded iniative to [educate the next generation of researchers to use and adopt  machine learning tools](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/geosmart/). As part of this effort we created an [online textbook](https://geo-smart.github.io/mlgeo-book/about_this_book/about_this_book.html) which used in the course offered at the University of Washington: Machine Learning in the Geoscienes (AUTMN 2023 - ESS 469/569)

### Geodynamics

Taught in 2016 at [Universidad de los Andes](https://geociencias.uniandes.edu.co), Bogota, Colombia. Most homework assignments were done as Jupyter Notebooks, made available [here](https://github.com/scottyhq/gpsdemo).
